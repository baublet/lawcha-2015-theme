# LAWCHA 2015
This is the theme for the Labor and Working-Class History Association's redesign, which I conducted throughout 2014 and 2015 while a PhD Candidate at Duke University, and took live in the Summer of 2015. Our 2015 default theme is clean and designed for clarity. Its simple, straightforward typography is readable on a wide variety of screen sizes. I designed it mobile-first, so that it uses few resources and looks great on any devices.

It is meant to be used with baublet/wp-twig-loop-shortcode and not as a drop-in and go theme. The way we handle it at [LAWCHA.org](http://lawcha.org) is like a CMS with heavy use of inline shortcodes and templates. You can also use plugins such as List Category Posts or similar plugins.

# Technologies

- LESS (using the Atom plugin to auto-compile it for you on save)
- YARPP (yet another related posts plugin) -- not required, but it's incorporated in here
- Advanced Custom Posts
- Uses custom thumbnail sizes and post types
- Custom Icomoon fonts -- for fast rendering. If you use this theme, use your own here!

# Todo

- [ ] Add banner images and create a "window into the past" page
- [ ] Custom events list
