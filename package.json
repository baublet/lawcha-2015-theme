  "description": "This is the theme for the Labor and Working-Class History Association's redesign, which I conducted throughout 2014 and 2015 while a PhD Candidate at Duke University, and took live in the Summer of 2015. Our 2015 default theme is clean and designed for clarity. Its simple, straightforward typography is readable on a wide variety of screen sizes. I designed it mobile-first, so that it uses few resources and looks great on any devices.",
